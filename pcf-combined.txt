  Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) tips

Topic: 
  How to do DR

Answers:
* `cf push` the application to both the prod and DR environments

* Add a shared domain to each foundation
  ```cf create-shared-domain telmore.io```

* Map the application to the shared domain
  ```cf map-route spring-music telmore.io -n spring-music```
  The `-n spring-music` is the _hostname_ but is actually treated as the subdomain.  Therefore, the url created above would be `&lt;http://spring-music.telmore.io|spring-music.telmore.io&gt;`

* The route is added to the application in both foundations - so they will have the same URL.  The route into the application would be controlled via DNS change.

* This can be tested by either changing DNS - or just editing /etc/hosts file

* The benefit of doing this is that consumers (users or other services) do not have to change the endpoint they are using.

Topic:
  Pivotal CloudCache installation problem

Answers:
* Having issues running the smoke test... following documentation here -&gt; <https://docs.pivotal.io/p-cloud-cache/1-9/prepare-TLS.html> and am not applying change to get the trusted certs installed.  Doing the apply change for all products and doing it manually.  If it works, I'll have to add it the automation.

Topic:
  When there are a lot of queued bosh tasks

Answers:
* When doing a `bosh tasks` and there are a lot of queued tasks and you want to remove them.

* Note: if this happens often, consider scaling up the size of the Director VM by increasing number of CPUs.

* There are a couple of options to remove the queued tasks.  Remember, that this puts the tasks into `cancelling` state and then bosh should take care of them.  If they do not go away, then you may have to ssh into the director and kill the tasks?

* 1. Run a script
  ```bosh tasks --column=ID --column=state --json | jq '.Tables[].Rows[].id' -Mr | xargs -n 1 bosh cancel-task```

* 2. Cancel all the tasks from Director <https://community.pivotal.io/s/article/How-to-Cancel-All-Queued-BOSH-Tasks-Using-director-ctl>

Topic:
  How to get credentials from command line

Answers:
* Preferred method...
  ```om credentials -p cf -c .uaa.admin_credentials -t json | jq .password -r```

* If you don't have jq...
  ```bosh int &lt;(om credentials -p cf -c .uaa.admin_credentials -t json) --path /password```

* To get a list of all the available credentials...
  ```om credential-references -p cf```

Topic:
  Setting up RDS database in AWS

Answers:
* Need a lot more detail here... but wanted to share this link...  <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html>

Topic:
  DNS Commands

Answers:
* To find if the DNS entries are set up, use nslookup
  `nslookup <http://www.tonyelmore.com|www.tonyelmore.com>`

* Since you can have many A records, nslookup for each of them
  `nslookup <http://tonyelmore.com|tonyelmore.com>`
  `nslookup <http://sys.sbx.tonyelmore.com|sys.sbx.tonyelmore.com>`
  
* You can add a TXT record to DNS and find it either using nslookup or dig
  `nslookup -type=txt <http://txtlabel.tonyelmore.com|txtlabel.tonyelmore.com>`
  `dig -t txt <http://txtlabel.tonyelmore.com|txtlabel.tonyelmore.com> +short`
  Where `txtlabel` is the TXT label on the DNS entry
  The `+short` option on dig command gets rid of all the cruft and just shows the value

* Difference between dig and nslookup...
  nslookup was the original tool and dig is a replacement
  dig +short will provide only the answer without all the extra output

  Seems like either can be used

Topic:
  Downloading a file by unsigned developer

Answers:
* `spctl --add /Path/To/om`

* When doing for `om` (and maybe others) would have to do a `chmod +x /Path/To/om`

Topic:
  Script to check persistent disk free space on all VMs

Answers:
* ```for i in `bosh --ty deployments --json | jq -r '.Tables[].Rows[] | name'`; 
    do echo -e "\033[1;32mDeployment Name: \033[0m" $i;
    DEPLOYMENT=$i;
    bosh --tty -d $DEPLOYMENT instances --vitals --json | jq -r '.Tables[].Rows[] | select(.persistent_disk_usage != "") | select((.persistent_disk_usage | split("%") | .[0] | tonumber) &gt;=70 | "Instance: " + .instance + ", Persistent Disk Usage: " + .persistent_disk_usage' | column -t;
    echo ;
    done```

Topic:
  Excessive audit logs being sent to splunk

Answers:
* look at `/etc/audit/audit.rules` and there is a `/etc/audit/audit.rules.prev` to show what previous rules were

* Apparently - OMS has an agent running on each VM and that talks back to the microsoft servers for the rules.  Microsoft can change the rules on the server which will then get applied to the VM via the agent.

Topic:
  How to find and delete bosh queued tasks

Answers:
* `for row in $(bosh tasks --json | jq -r '.Tables[].Rows[] | select(.state=="queued").id'); do bosh cancel-task $row -n; done`

Topic:
  Look thru VMs and show disk usage

Answers:
* ```s_inst="service-instance_xxxxx"; bosh -d "${s_inst}" vms | awk '{print $1}' | while read instance; do bosh -d "${s_inst}" ssh "${instance}" -c "sudo df -h /" | grep ": stdout "; done```

Topic:
  Enable / Disable opsman validators

Answers:
* We were having issues with Azure VM creation timing out.  So, we disabled the validators until there was a fix in opsman.

* ```om curl -p /api/v0/staged/director/verifiers/install_time/IaasConfigurationVerifier -x PUT -d '{ "enabled": true }'```

* To see the current status of the validators...
  ```om curl -p /api/v0/staged/director/verifiers/install_time```
